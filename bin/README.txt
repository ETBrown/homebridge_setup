The BIN Files are for if/when you want to use the local homebridge commands.

The Bin files here go on the machine the Raspberry pi will be connecting to.

I have this all setup if, for example, you want to control something on a computer.
Push SSH keys of Raspberry pi and have the Homebridge Local Command be:
 "ssh destination-host 'sudo /usr/local/bin/run_my_command'"

I think this is a little cleaner and easier to manage. Change if you disagree
